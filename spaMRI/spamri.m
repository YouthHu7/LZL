%%% spaMRI toolbox (Surface-based Processing & Analysis for MRI)
% The spaMRI toolbox is MATLAB-programmed based on Freesurfer software, aiming
% at simplification of surface-based freesurfer pipeline. The current
% toolbox includes the following functions:
%   1. automatic recon-all steps and quality checking
%   2. friendly used statistical analysis
%   3. viewing and reporting of statistical results
%   4. convertion between different data types
%   5. extract surface measurements of ROI

% It's hopeful that the spaMRI toolbox is useful for scientific research. Any
% suggestion will be appreciated.
